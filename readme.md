# processing-scala-sbt

This is a template project for developing [Processing](http://processing.org) programs in Scala. Includes:

* Processing core library and source
* SBT project and IDEA project

Everything needed to get up and running with Processing and Scala quickly! To automatically compile and run after each code change:

    sbt ~run

The next compile/run cycle will automatically start when the previous process ends and the you save a code change.
